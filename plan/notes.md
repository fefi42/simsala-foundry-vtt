Testing prompts:

Create a poison that makes the person irresistable but slowly kills them.

Armor that makes the person look bigger than they are making them harder to hit.

A cursed ring that tells the creator where the person is who wears it.


A blood cultist acolyte who is able to drain blood from creatures if they fail a saving throw.


Issues to investigate later:

* Generate actions, reactions etc.
* Data source system

* Configuration and UX
    * Allow configuration of sources in app settings
    * Add model validation and install help directly into app if model is not detected
    * Don't just drop raw json show nice property overview where we can accept them one by one. (JSON option should still be an option if debug settings are turned on)



* Weapon generated without damage type filled.
* Start model already in background so it doesn't need so long to load?
* Reflavouring system (low prio)
* Add other sources as options (low prio)
