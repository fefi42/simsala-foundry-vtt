Testing prompts:

Create a poison that makes the person irresistable but slowly kills them.

Armor that makes the person look bigger than they are making them harder to hit.

A cursed ring that tells the creator where the person is who wears it.


A blood cultist acolyte who is able to drain blood from creatures if they fail a saving throw.


Issues to investigate later:

* Weapon generated without damage type filled.
* Unit tests to avoid regression.
* Start model already in background so it doesn't need so long to load?
